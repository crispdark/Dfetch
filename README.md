# Dfetch

Dfetch allows you to display system information in a simple, fast and visually appealing way. Dfetch focuses on looking clean and compact by default while still showing usefull info. It also tries to be very fast so you can autostart it with your terminal without having to wait. Dfetch also avoids using external dependencies.

## Why use this?

I dont really think there is much of a reason to use this over the many other options there are out there. I'm just working on this for fun and it doesnt really fill any gap in the market. Its not worse then most other options but not different either.

## Installation

You can install Dfetch from the releases page:

[Dfetch Releases](https://github.com/David17c/Dfetch/releases)

Download the version that matches your Linux distribution.

If no compatible release is available for your distro, using the steps below you can compile Dfetch from source instead.

### Step 1

Go to the main GitHub repository page:

[Dfetch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/David17c/Dfetch)

Click the green Code button, then select Download ZIP.

### Step 2

Unzip the file you just downloaded and navigate to it in the terminal using the `cd` command.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Dfetch
```

### Step 3

Install the [Go](https://go.dev/) programming language. This step is different depending on your distro.

Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install golang-go
```

Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S go
```

Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install golang
```

You can verify it's installed by running:

```bash
go version
```

### Step 4

Now that you have Go installed and have navigated to the root of the project folder, run:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o build/Dfetch
```

To compile the program and store the executable file in the `Dfetch/build` folder.

You can now execute the file you just created and use the program.

## Usage

Run Dfetch using:

```bash
dfetch
```

Or, if you compiled it from source:

```bash
./build/Dfetch
```

## Customization

When you first run Dfetch it creates a config file in `~/.config/Dfetch/Dfetch.conf`.

Default config file:

```
// Lines starting with `//` are comments and are ignored by Dfetch.
// In the System Information section you can change what info is displayed and in what order.
