# Dfetch

A clean and practical system information tool focused on clean, easy to understand output and fast startup times. It is designed to provide useful system information while being lightweight enough to launch instantly with your terminal.

## Why use this?

Dfetch does not try to compete with heavily customizable alternatives like [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) or [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch). The project exists mainly as a fun project for myself, while still being useful for those who prefer clean, easy to configure tools with good defaults.

## Installation

Currently no official package for any platform is provided. You can either build Dfetch from source or [download the latest prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/David17c/Dfetch/releases).
